This is an example character template for the more experienced Slay the Spire modder.
It contains the basics of an empty character, as well as:
- Improved X cost action framework (Alchyr)
- General action use wizard for any effects (GK + my own stuff)
- Lambda power support (mine)
- Automatic ability to apply TempPowers. Make any power a Flex! (me)
- AbstractRelic, Power and Card with improved image loading and other shortcuts (alchyr + mine)
- AbstractCard comes with secondary variable and secondary damage (me + Kio)
- IntelliJ template to easily make lots of cards (me + GK)
- Hopefully more! Let me know if there's something you'd want added!!

Setup guide:
1. Download the project. Create a folder named whatever you want your mod's main name to be (like TheGemcrafter) and put all the files in there.
2. Rename project. (IntelliJ -> File -> Project Structure... -> Project Name)
3. Change module name. (Right-click that first folder you made, Refactor -> Rename, and change the "module name" to match the new folder name.)
4. Go into your pom.xml, and change the path to your steam installation, the artifactId, version number, name, description, and modID fields inside of that.
5. Rename the enclosing mod folder. (the folder just under Java, initially named theGemcrafter.)
6. Rename the mod's Resources folder. (the folder under the "resources" folder, initially named todomodResources.)
7. Rename the modded character file. (the class initially named TheTodo, not in a folder.)
8. Rename the main mod file. (the class initially named TodoMod, not in a folder.)
9. In the main mod file, change the modID to match the modID field in your pom.xml.

10+. You'll probably want to rename your character in the CharStrings file to start off. From there, it's just making the mod of your dreams!
